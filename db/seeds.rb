# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# Speaker.create({first_name: "Jason", last_name: "Bateman", email: "jb@aol.com"})
# Speaker.create({first_name: "Toni", last_name: "Morrison", email: "tm@gmail.com"})
